**Introduction** <br>
This serves as my course design of *compiler principle* course during *2022 Spring*. <br>
I will continue improving it for fun. And I will experiment with some newly learned cpp tricks on it since I have no other projects now:) <br>


**To-do:** <br>
CMake debug&release and cross-platform, <br>
use benchmark to test the data structure, <br>
semantic analyzer and LLVM backend, <br>

###Introduction
This project is the course design of "compiler principle", and also where I experimented with my newly learned cpp tricks. <br>
I hope to complete the little compiler with LLVM in my spare time...


###TODO:
CMake debug&release, <br>
use benchmark to test the data structure, <br>
LLVM
